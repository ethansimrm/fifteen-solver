# fifteen-solver

This is my basic solver for Loyd's Fifteen Puzzle in the CodeSkulptor browser-based IDE, which was created by the Rice University Department of Computer Science.

Due to the highly specific nature of the GUI, it only works in CodeSkulptor - you can access it at https://py2.codeskulptor.org/#user48_1DCKXwMZkx_109.py.

You can use the arrow keys to scramble the board, and watch as the programme autocompletes it (without logging your moves!)
